# Date Planner

## Motivation

As a student, I often have little time to spend time with friends or to go out on my own and even less time to plan days out. This motivated the idea of this application, which has a purpose of letting people spend less time planning days out and more time going out.

## Description

The Date Planner project aims to develop a comprehensive web application that automates and optimizes
the process of planning daily activities. This full-stack solution will enable users to efficiently organize,
visualize, and manage their schedules for individual or group activities. The application will incorporate
location-based services, intelligent recommendations, and interactive planning tools to enhance user
productivity and experience.

## Project Scope

The application will implement secure user authentication, comprehensive calendar management,
geolocation services, intuitive schedule manipulation, and collaborative planning capabilities. The
primary objective is to deliver a robust, user-friendly platform that simplifies daily planning while
offering advanced features for optimized time management

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
